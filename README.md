## Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook document outlining the case study is the file labeled [CS2Hook_Alzheimers.pdf](/CS2Hook_Alzheimers.pdf). The rubric [CS2Rubric_Alzheimers.pdf](/CS2Rubric_Alzheimers.pdf) outlines the formatting, submission requirements, final deliverables for this assignment. Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.

## Data
There is one dataset given for this project, [spotify_data.csv](Data/spotify_data.csv). This data was pulled from my own Top 50 Spotify playlist using [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). The data dictionary within the folder details the data type and provides descriptions for each field. For an additional bonus, Spotify users in the class can additionally generate their own dataset utilizing the API and leverage their built song recommendation system on this new data. If you’re not a Spotify user, there are plenty of Spotify datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) like the default one provided that can be used instead of a new one.

## Reference Materials

[Algorithmic Effects on the Diversity of Consumption on Spotify](https://github.com/ayk2ea/DS4002-CS2_Spotify/blob/main/Reference%20Materials/Algorithmic-Effects-on-the-Diversity-of-Consumption-on-Spotify.pdf) by Ashton Anderson, Lucas Maystre, Rishabh Mehrotra, Ian Anderson, and Mounia Lalmas. This journal article contextualizes how this case study could be furthered past just generating a song recommendation model and the questions recommendation systems provoke in the larger idea of how we consume music and the types of music we listen to.

[Uncovering How the Spotify Algorithm Works](https://github.com/ayk2ea/DS4002-CS2_Spotify/blob/main/Reference%20Materials/Uncovering%20How%20the%20Spotify%20Algorithm%20Works%20_%20by%20Hucker%20Marius%20_%20Towards%20Data%20Science.pdf) by Hucker Marius, published in Towards Data Science, a Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes among data scientists. This blog post provides a concise description how Spotify's recommendation algorithm works, which will provide the the student with a basic framework to approach the model building of the assignment.
