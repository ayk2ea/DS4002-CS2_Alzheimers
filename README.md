# Alzheimer’s Image Classification Case Study
### A DS 4002 Case Study by Ashley Kim

## Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook document outlining the case study is the file labeled [CS2Hook_Alzheimers.pdf](/CS2Hook_Alzheimers.pdf). The rubric [CS2Rubric_Alzheimers.pdf](/CS2Rubric_Alzheimers.pdf) outlines the formatting, submission requirements, final deliverables for this assignment. Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.

## Data
The image data can be found on Kaggle linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahidzikria/alz-dataset) and in the Data folder. This directory is divided into four classes of Alzheimer stages datasets and is not seperated into training and testing, which will be part of your analysis. The data dictionary within the folder details the datatypes and descriptions for each field. In addition, there is a folder within the Data folder titled [PredictionData](). Here you will find 5 images that you must put through your image classification model to see how well it predicts with new data.

This journal article contextualizes how this case study could be furthered past just generating a song recommendation model and the questions recommendation systems provoke in the larger idea of how we consume music and the types of music we listen to.

This blog post provides a concise description on convolutional neural networks for image classification, providing the student with a basic framework to approach the model building portion of the assignment.
